=============

My collection of dotfiles

My machine is a mac running macOS Big Sur. I use the
built in zsh. I've used oh-my-zsh in the past, but 
I haven't installed it yet for this build. I'm 
adding thing myself to learn more about how things 
work. 

I'm not sure how other folks do it, but I'm keeping 
these all in one directory and then sym link to them
from wherever the actual locations are. 

Suggestions welcome.
