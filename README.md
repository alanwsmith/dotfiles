# TheDotsOfAlan

This is my collection of dotfiles

My machine is a mac running macOS Monterey. I use the
built in zsh. While I've used oh-my-zsh in the past, 
I decided to run stock and build my own customizations
to learn more about how things work.

My approach for these files it to keep everything in
the repo directory and then use symbolic links to make
them appear in their proper places.
